## About ALX Africa

ALX Africa is a leading software engineering school that provides students with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the technology industry. The school emphasizes project-based learning, enabling students to gain hands-on experience while working on real-world projects.

## About the Low Level Programming Track

The Low Level Programming track at ALX Africa focuses on developing proficiency in programming languages and concepts close to the hardware layer. The curriculum is designed to provide a strong foundation in computer architecture, memory management, data structures, algorithms, and the C programming language.

Throughout the track, students gain practical experience in writing efficient and optimized code, understanding memory allocation and management, implementing data structures and algorithms, and debugging low-level issues.

## Projects

This repository serves as a showcase for the projects I completed as part of the ALX Low Level Programming track. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a README file with detailed information about the project and its objectives.

The following are the projects I completed:

1. **0x00-hello_world**: Introduction to the C programming language and basic compilation.
2. **0x01-variables_if_else_while**: Variable declaration, conditional statements, and loops in C.
3. **0x02-functions_nested_loops**: Writing and using functions, nested loops, and basic algorithms.
4. **0x03-debugging**: Techniques and strategies for debugging C programs.
5. **0x04-more_functions_nested_loops**: More advanced functions and nested loops in C.
6. **0x05-pointers_arrays_strings**: Pointers, arrays, and string manipulation in C.
7. **0x06-pointers_arrays_strings**: More advanced pointer and string manipulation in C.
8. **0x07-pointers_arrays_strings**: Pointers to pointers and multidimensional arrays in C.
9. **0x08-recursion**: Understanding and implementing recursive functions in C.
10. **0x09-static_libraries**: Creating and using static libraries in C.
11. **0x0A-argc_argv**: Command-line arguments and argument parsing in C.
12. **0x0B-malloc_free**: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C.
13. **0x0C-more_malloc_free**: Advanced memory allocation and deallocation in C.
14. **0x0D-preprocessor**: Macros and the C preprocessor in C programming.
15. **0x0E-structures_typedef**: Structures and typedef in C.
16. **0x0F-function_pointers**: Function pointers and their usage in C.
17. **0x10-variadic_functions**: Variadic functions in C.
18. **0x11-singly_linked_lists**: Implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists in C.
19. **0x12-more_singly_linked_lists**: storing and manipulation of data in C.
20. **0x13-more_singly_linked_lists**:  algorithms with singly linked lists in C.
21. **0x14-bit_manipulation**: Bit manipulation and bitwise operations in C.
22. **0x15-file_io**: File input/output operations in C.
23. **0x17-doubly_linked_lists**: complex compared to a singly linked list in C.
24. **0x18-dynamic_libraries**: separate pieces of object code in C.
25. **0x1A-hash_tables**:  a data structure which stores data in associative manner in C.
26. **0x1C-makefiles**: organize code compilation in C.
27. **0x1E-search_algorithms**: retrieve an element from any data structure in which it is stored in C.
